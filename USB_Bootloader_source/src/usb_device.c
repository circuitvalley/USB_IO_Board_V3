 *                  meet this by suspending the USB module, and either clock switching
 *                  to a low frequency or sleeping.  This is not necessary if the
 *                  application is self powered, or if it doesn't need to meet

 *                     to prepare EP0 for the control transfer.
 *                     Refer to USBCtrlEPServiceComplete() for more details.
 *
 * Note:            Microchip USB Firmware has three different states for
 *                  the control transfer state machine:
 *                  1. WAIT_SETUP
